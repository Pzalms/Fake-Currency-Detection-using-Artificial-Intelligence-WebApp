This is a repository for a fake currency detection project that uses computer vision techniques to identify counterfeit banknotes. The project aims to help financial institutions, banks, and businesses detect fake currency more accurately and efficiently, thereby reducing financial losses and fraudulent activities.

The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify banknotes as real or fake. The CNN is trained on a dataset of real and fake currency images and can accurately identify counterfeit notes with high precision.

The project is written in Python using various libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of real and fake currency notes. The images were collected from various sources and include different denominations and currencies. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, with a total of 575 images.


The following libraries are required to run the project:
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
